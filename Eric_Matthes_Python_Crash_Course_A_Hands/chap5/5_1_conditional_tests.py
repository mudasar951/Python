#5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement 
#describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code 
#should look something like this:
# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')
# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')
# •	Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line 
#evaluates to True or False.
# •	Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and 
#another five tests evaluate to False.

car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')

car = 'audi'
print("Is car == 'audi'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'audi')
print("\nIs car == 'subaru'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'subaru')

car = 'bmw'
print("Is car == 'bmw'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'bmw')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')

car = 'mercedes'
print("Is car == 'mercedes'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'mercedes')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')

car = 'Alson'
print("Is car == 'Alson'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'Alson')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')
