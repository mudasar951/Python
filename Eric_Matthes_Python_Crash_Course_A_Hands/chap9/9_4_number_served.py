# 9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162). 
# Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an 
# instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the 
# restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.
#  Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number 
# of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and 
# print the value again.
#  Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment 
# the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any num
# ber you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a 
# day of business.
