# 9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name 
# and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored 
# in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary 
# of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints 
# a personalized greeting to the user.
#  Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods 
# for each user.
