#6-8. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a differ
#ent pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s name. 
#Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list and as 
#you do, print everything you know about each pet.

pets = [pet_1, pet_2, pet_3]
