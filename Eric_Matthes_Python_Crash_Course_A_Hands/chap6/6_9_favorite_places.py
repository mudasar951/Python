#6-9. Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three 
#names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places 
#for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends 
#to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print 
#each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.
