Notice that converting the string to lowercase using lower() catches 
all appearances of the word you’re looking for, regardless of how it’s 
formatted.
 Write a program that reads the files you found at Project Gutenberg and 
determines how many times the word 'the' appears in each text. This will be 
an approximation because it will also count words such as 'then' and 'there'. 
Try counting 'the ', with a space in the string, and see how much lower your 
count is.
